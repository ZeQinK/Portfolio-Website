          <h4>SPLASH Awards Singapore</h4>
          <h5>Finalist</h5>
          <p>SPLASH awards is an annual competition organised by Singapore Computing Society. In this competition, my team has chosen to tackle the issue of social cohesion and cultural heritage by creating an app. During the process, I have undergone a UI/UX design workshop hosted by my mentor, Mr Eric (CEO of Advocado and alumni of AHS), crafting our presentation slides, speeches and proposal, and of course creating our app’s user interface using Figma. My team managed to emerge to Stage B and was one of the top 24 pre-tertiary teams in Singapore. Although we did not go to the finals, this competition has allowed me to  gain a lot of insights in the technology world and to think how I can contribute back to society using technology which gives me a greater sense of purpose of why I should continue my path in the tech world!
